PaperSize
=========
A A0 sheet of paper is 841mm × 1189mm (its surface is one square meter). Successive measurements of paper
are defined recursively as “half” or “double” the preceding size. Therefore, a A1 sheet of paper is half of
A0, or 594mm × 841mm; while a A00 is double of Din-A0, or 1189mm× 1682mm.
